# todolist
 Projeto para aprendizado em Docker + Postgre


I created this project in order to learn Docker and Jest.

Overall, it's just a simple todolist; but has some nice things about it.
Like: unitary tests, something like a "MVC" architecture and Docker stuff.

I used the following technologies to develop: TypeScript, Jest, Express, Docker, Handlebars and CSS.
